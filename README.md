# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Tnis is my first attempt at creating a game using Python - part of my cloud engineering course at AiCore.

## Description
The Hangman Game Project is an evolving Hangman game that starts as a simple guessing game. It randomly selects a fruit from a predefined list of five fruits, and the player is prompted to guess a letter from the chosen fruit. The aim of the project is to progressively build upon the basic game, introducing new features and challenges.
