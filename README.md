# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

Tnis is my first attempt at creating a game using Python - part of my cloud engineering course at AiCore.

## Description
The Hangman Game Project is an evolving Hangman game that starts as a simple guessing game. It randomly selects a fruit from a predefined list of five fruits, and the player is prompted to guess a letter from the chosen fruit. The aim of the project is to progressively build upon the basic game, introducing new features and challenges.

### Project Goals
- Build a foundational Hangman game
- Expand the game's complexity over time
- Provide an interactive and enjoyable gaming experience

1. I will start off with conditional statements to create a basic version of the Hangman game that asks for user input and validates if the input is valid before checking whether the user's input is a correct guess.

2. Defining functions

3. Building a class

### What I Learned
Throughout the development of this project, I aim to enhance my programming skills, especially in areas related to game development, user input handling, and project evolution.

## Installation
To run the Hangman Game Project on your local machine, follow these installation instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fredringrose/hangman420.git
